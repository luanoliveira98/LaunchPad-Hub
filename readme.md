# 🚀 LaunchPad Hub

**LaunchPad Hub** is a curated monorepo of high-performance boilerplates and modular components designed to accelerate software development. It serves as a personal "Foundational Layer," showcasing production-ready architectures, automated workflows, and scalable code patterns across multiple tech stacks.

## 🛠️ The Vision

Starting a new project often involves hours of repetitive boilerplate setup—auth, mailers, database schemas, and CI/CD pipelines. **LaunchPad Hub** solves this by providing a "Ready-to-Code" environment where architectural decisions are already made and tested, allowing developers to focus on business logic from day one.
As a **Portfolio Project**, it demonstrates:

- **Modular Architecture:** High cohesion and low coupling in every template.
- **Industrial Standards:** Full TypeScript support, strict linting, and comprehensive testing.
- **Developer Experience (DX):** Streamlined setup via Docker and automation scripts.

## 🛠️ Feature Highlights (The "Core" Modules)

Each template in this hub is built with a "Batteries-Included" philosophy:

- **🔐Authentication & Security:** Pre-configured JWT strategies, Refresh Token rotation, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **📧Automated Communication:** Transactional email integration using `@nestjs-modules/mailer` with Handlebars templates.
- **🗄️Database Reliability:** Robust ORM integration (Prisma) with ready-to-use migration patterns and Seeders.
- **🧪Testing Culture:** Pre-configured test suites using Vitest and Supertest for End-to-End (E2E) validation.
- **🐳Containerization:** Multi-stage `Dockerfiles` and `docker-compose.yml` for environment parity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The **LaunchPad Hub** features a built-in interactive CLI to scaffold new projects instantly. This automation ensures that every new service starts with your pre-defined standards for code quality, commit patterns, and architecture.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- One of the following: **npm, yarn, or pnpm**
- **Git**

### 2. Generating a New Template

If you want to create a new blueprint for the Hub:

```Bash
bash scripts/generate-template.sh
```

### 3. Generating a Final Project

To start a new application based on an existing template:

```Bash
bash scripts/generate-project.sh
```

### 3. What happens behind the scenes?

When you run the generator, the script performs the following actions:

- **Clones the Template:** Copies the base structure of the selected framework.
- **Injects Shared Configs:** Copies global configurations (Prettier, ESLint, Commitlint) from the `tooling/` folder.
- **Initializes Git:** Starts a fresh Git repository.
- **Configures Git Hooks:** Installs Husky and sets up the `commit-msg` hook to enforce Conventional Commits.
- **Dynamic Setup:** Renames the project in `package.json` and runs the final installation with your chosen package manager.

## 🏗️Technical Standards

All projects generated by this hub follow these strict quality gates:
| Feature | Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Commit Pattern | [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) | Enforces Conventional Commits (feat, fix, chore, etc.) |
| Git Hooks | [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) | Runs linters and commit validation locally |
| Code Style | [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) | Consistent formatting across all languages |
| Static Analysis | [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) | Catches code smells and potential bugs |

**Why I built this:** As a developer, I value efficiency and consistency. This hub allows me to bypass the "boring" setup phase and jump straight into solving business problems, while ensuring that even a prototype has production-level quality controls from the very first commit.
